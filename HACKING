----------------------------------
General info:

To run Le Chef on your computer, execute update.sh. It configures the server, and then runs nginx and node.js.

You need to execute it every time you modified any of the source files.

Currently, it does not install/configure the server and database itself, but I am planning on adding this feature sometime in the future if we do not switch to Vagrant.

All the source code is located in app/src.

Html files are located in src/html, client-side javascript in src/userjs, and node.js code is in src/serverjs.

Misc folder contains nginx.conf file which configures nginx to forward all 404's (non-found files) to node server.

----------------------------------
node code info:

When nginx gets a request for a file it cannot find, it passes control to node, which is running on port 8888.

Main node file is index.js, so it receives control when node is called. It manages all the other files.
